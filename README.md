# 2D-Signal-Image-Transforms
The program implements forward and inverse version of 2D Discrete Fourier Transform (FFT), Discrete Cosine Transform, Discrete Walsh-Hadamard Transform and Discrete Wavelets Transform (lifting scheme) in C/C++. The output of transforms is displayed for a given input image.
